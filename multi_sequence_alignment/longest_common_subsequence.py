# The shift algorithm consist on finding the Longest Common Subsequence between
# a sequence 'a' and 'b' by comparing the last element of 'a' with the first
# element of 'b', and finding the longest sequence between the common elements,
# then shifting 'a' to the right, and comparing the next two elements, and so
# on, until reach the right wall, then shifting 'b' to the left until reach the
# left wall.
# This is a non-recursive algorithm, and the maximum number of comparissons are:
# (len(a) + len(b) - 1)**2.
